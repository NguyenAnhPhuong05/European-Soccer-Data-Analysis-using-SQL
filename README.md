# European-Soccer-Data-Analysis-using-SQL
## Project Overview
A European Soccer Database that has more than 25,000 matches and more than 10,000 players for European professional soccer seasons from 2008 to 2016. The goal is to walk through this database to do an analysis including some steps for exploring our dataset, and some steps for basic statistics, and then visualize the result. To complete all your steps, you need to query your data in the database using SQL statements. This project practices you write SQL commands to pull data and extract it.
